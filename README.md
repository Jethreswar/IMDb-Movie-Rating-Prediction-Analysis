**Project Description:**
This Movie Recommendation System will suggest personalized movies based on what users like and have watched before. It uses data mining and some concepts of machine learning to study user behavior and suggest movies that match their interests. The project involves organizing data and training the system to make accurate recommendations.

**Project Objectives:** 
1) Create a system that suggests movies based on user preferences to improve the viewing experience for all users. 
2) Utilize cutting edge data mining methods, such as content based and collaborative filtering, to identify trends and draw insightful conclusions from a sizable movie dataset. 
3) By using machine learning algorithms to comprehend user preferences and behavior, concentrate on enhancing recommendation accuracy and precision to produce more pertinent movie recommendations. 
4) In order to provide a varied and comprehensive collection of movie recommendations that go beyond conventional genre-based suggestions, develop a recommendation system that takes into account both user preferences and movie attributes. 
5) Create a scalable and flexible system that can handle big datasets and changing user preferences over time to provide a reliable and efficient movie recommendation system.
